Python scripting, Data Preprocessing, Visualization, EDA, Streamlit, MongoDb, PowerBI

This project aims to analyze Airbnb data.
The objectives are to:

Establish a MongoDB connection, retrieve the Airbnb dataset, and ensure efficient data retrieval for analysis.

Clean and prepare the dataset, addressing missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions for accurate analysis.

Develop a streamlit web application with interactive maps showcasing the distribution of Airbnb listings, allowing users to explore prices, ratings, and other relevant factors.

Conduct price analysis and visualization, exploring variations based on location, property type, and seasons using dynamic plots and charts.

Analyze availability patterns across seasons, visualizing occupancy rates and demand fluctuations using suitable visualizations.

Investigate location-based insights by extracting and visualizing data for specific regions or neighborhoods.

Create interactive visualizations that enable users to filter and drill down into the data. 

Build a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI, combining various visualizations to present key insights from the analysis.
